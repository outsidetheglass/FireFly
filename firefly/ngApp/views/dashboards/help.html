                        <p>Thousands of productions are funding on Firefly at any given moment. Each production is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Firefly have complete control and responsibility over their productions. They spend weeks building their production pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they feel ready, a creator can launch their production on the site and share it with their community.</p>
                        <p>Every production creator sets their production's funding goal and deadline. If people like the production, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the production succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the production falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Firefly is all-or-nothing.</p>

                        <p>Everything on Firefly must be a production. A production has a clear goal, like making a short film, a movie, or TV episodes. A production will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.</p>
                        <p>Firefly does not allow productions to fundraise for charity or offer financial incentives.

                    <div class="faq_answer">
                        <p>All-or-nothing funding is a core part of Firefly and it has a number of advantages:</p>
                        <p><i>It's less risk for everyone.</i> If you need $5,000, it's tough having $1,000 and a bunch of people expecting you to complete a $5,000 production. </p>
                        <p><i>It motivates.</i> If people want to see a production come to life, they're going to spread the word.   </p>
                        <p><i>It works. </i>Of the productions that have reached 20% of their funding goal, 81% were successfully funded. Of the productions that have reached 60% of their funding goal, 98% were successfully funded. productions either make their goal or find little support. There's little in-between.</p>

                        <p>Many backers are rallying around their friends' productions. Some are supporting a new effort from someone they've long admired. Some are just inspired by a new idea, while others are motivated to pledge by a production's rewards — a copy of what's being produced, a limited edition, or a custom experience related to the production.</p><p>Backing a production is more than just pledging funds to a creator. It's pledging your support to a creative idea that you want to see exist in the world.</p>

                    <div class="faq_answer">
                        <p>The majority of initial funding usually comes from the fans and friends of each production. If they like it, they'll spread the word to their friends, and so on. Press, blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and Firefly itself are also big sources of traffic and pledges. Altogether, millions of people visit Firefly every week.</p>

                        <p>Launching a Firefly is a very public act, and creators put their reputations at risk when they do.</p><p>Backers should look for creators who share a clear plan for how their production will be completed, and who have a history of bringing their creative ventures and other productions to fruition. Creators are encouraged to share links and as much background information as possible so backers can make informed decisions about the productions they support.</p>
                        <p>If a creator has no demonstrable experience in doing something like their production or doesn't share key information, backers should take that into consideration.

                        <p>If problems come up, creators are expected to post a production update explaining the situation. Sharing the story, speed bumps and all, is crucial. Most backers support productions because they want to see something happen and they'd like to be a part of it. Creators who are honest and transparent will usually find backers to be understanding.</p><p>It's not uncommon for things to take longer than expected. Sometimes the execution of the production proves more difficult than the creator had anticipated. If a creator is making a good faith effort to complete their production and is transparent about it, backers should do their best to be patient and understanding while demanding continued accountability from the creator.</p><p>If the problems are severe enough that the creator can't fulfill their production, creators need to find a resolution. Steps should include offering refunds, detailing exactly how funds were used, and other actions to satisfy backers. </p>

                    <div class="faq_answer">
                        <p>When a production is successfully funded, the creator is responsible for completing the production and fulfilling each reward. Their fundamental obligation to backers is to finish all the work that was promised. Once a creator has done so, they’ve fulfilled their obligation to their backers. At the same time, backers must understand that Firefly is not a store. When you back a production, you’re helping to create something new — not ordering something that already exists. There’s a chance something could happen that prevents the creator from being able to finish the production as promised. If a creator is absolutely unable to complete the production and fulfill rewards, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the production to a satisfying conclusion for their backers.</p>
