        <h3>About Firefly</h3>

        <p>Firefly is an innovative approach to crowd-funding movies and episodes that are no longer being produced.
        The inspiration to create FireFly came from a desire to have closure when a series with a cult following abruptly,
            or there is a desire to create an entirely new production based on contribution to its stated budget.</p>
